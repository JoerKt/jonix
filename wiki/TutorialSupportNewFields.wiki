= Introduction =

In this tutorial we'll add the `Measure` composite of ONIX, which has the following typical form:
{{{
<Measure>
	<MeasureTypeCode>01</MeasureTypeCode>
	<Measurement>9.25</Measurement>
	<MeasureUnitCode>in</MeasureUnitCode>
</Measure>
<Measure>
	<MeasureTypeCode>02</MeasureTypeCode>
	<Measurement>6.25</Measurement>
	<MeasureUnitCode>in</MeasureUnitCode>
</Measure>
<Measure>
	<MeasureTypeCode>03</MeasureTypeCode>
	<Measurement>1.2</Measurement>
	<MeasureUnitCode>in</MeasureUnitCode>
</Measure>
}}}
