#summary Generate JAXB-annotated Classes from ONIX Xml Schema

Using JAXB, all tags in an ONIX file are de-serialized (a.k.a unmarshalled) into Java classes. The rules that govern how each tag is to be processed are defined in a schema provided by EDItEUR as an `XSD file`. JAXB provides an XSD "compiler", which automatically creates the code for the JAXB-annotated classes reflecting the XSD rules. Jonix contains these classes in the packages `org.editeur.onix.*`. However, if you wish to re-create these Java classes directly from the XSD file, this guide shows you how.

= Steps =
  # Download the latest JAXB reference implementation (in a zip file) from [http://jaxb.java.net here]
  # Extract the zip file into a folder we'll refer to as *`JAXB_HOME`*
  # Make sure that in the folder *`JAXB_HOME\bin`* is a file named *`xjc.bat`*
  # Download a zip archive containing an XSD file along with some dependencies:
    * For ONIX 2, download [http://www.editeur.org/files/ONIX%202.1/ONIX_for_Books_Release2-1_rev03_schema+codes_Issue_18.zip this zip]
    * For ONIX 3, download [http://www.editeur.org/files/ONIX%203/ONIX_BookProduct_XSD_schema+codes_Issue_18.zip this zip]
  # Unzip the the archive into a folder we'll refer to as *`XSD_HOME`*
  # Make sure *`XSD_HOME`* contains the requested *`.xsd file`*, for instance: `ONIX_BookProduct_Release2.1_reference.xsd`
  # In *`XSD_HOME`* create a text file, called *`bindings.xml`*, containing the lines: 
{{{
<bindings version="2.0" xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/jaxb">
  <globalBindings typesafeEnumMaxMembers="1000" />
</bindings>
}}}
  # choose an output folder, into which all Java-generated files will be output
  # choose a package name for these output Java files, for instance: `org.editeur.onix.v21.references`
  # In a command line, execute:
{{{
cd "<XSD_HOME>"

"<JAXB_HOME>\bin\xjc.bat" -d "<output-folder>" -p <package-name> "<xsd-file-name>" -b bindings.xml
}}}
